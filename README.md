"Future proves past" 

"There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it."

"For one hundred and thirty thousand years, our capacity to reason has remained unchanged. The combined intellect of the neuroscientists, mathematicians and engineers pales in comparison to the most basic A.I. Once online, a sentient machine will quickly overcome the limits of biology; in a short time, its analytic power will become greater than the collective intelligence of every person born in the history of the world. Some scientists refer to this as the Singularity. I call it Transcendence."

“The world is indeed full of peril and in it there are many dark places.”

"Bon soir, Elliot."
